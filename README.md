# Stains on the Brain

This project is a mishmash between Rorschach ink blot tests and a social network app. It uses the very well-structured MEAN seed. I have been switching over our MySQL database to Mongo.

#Here's the idea:

We created over a 100 watercolor stains. Players view one stain at a time and select the closest thing they see. Here's an example.

![stain](/public/images/32.png "Stain # 32")
                                                                                                                                                               
Choices: 1. A goodbye, 2. muddy waters, 3. mountain, 4. ephemerality


Then the stain reveals what it really is.

Players get a list of matches of people who see the same things they do. Players can chat and interact with their matches.

You also get diagnosed with a fun psychological disorder!
