# Stains on the Brain

This project is a mishmash between Rorschach ink blot tests and a social network app.

#Here's the idea:

We created over a 100 watercolor stains. Players view one stain at a time and select the closest thing they see.
Example: 
![stain](/public/images/32.png "Stain # 32")
Choices: 1. A goodbye, 2. muddy waters, 3. mountain, 4. ephemerality


Then the stain reveals what it really is. 

![nose](/public/images/the_nose.jpg "Stain # 32")

Players get a list of matches of people who see the same things they do. Players can chat and interact with their matches.

You also get diagnosed with a fun psychological disorder!
